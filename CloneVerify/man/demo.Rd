\title{A stndard data set of SNP data of 3 clonal references and 65 Uknown samples that need to be identified as one of the three clones.}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with 68 rows and 10 columns.
}
\usage{
demo
}
\description{
I have included an example of our data called "DemoData.csv".
The 3 clones in this data set are (Criollo_22, Matina_1_6, Pound_7).
Each row in the data set represents an individual tree. The columns are:
}
\details{
Chip.BC = The chip barcode the genotyping was done on.

Well = The location of the sample on the chip

ID = The status of the tree. Whether it is a clonal reference (Criollo_22, Matina_1_6, Pound_7) or if it the sample/tree that is an unknown( we do not know what it is a clone of). Unknowns can happen for a lot of reasons such as loss of tag information, or poorly kept maps.

DC= A unique identifier given to each sample/tree

Columns 5-10: Are 10 SNP marker names that are used for "offtyping" the trees. These specific markers are used for these three clones because they result in  1 = homozygote_1,  2= homozygote_2, 3= Heterozygote. So they make it really easy to tell these three clones apart.
